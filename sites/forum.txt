I've written a few scripts for Megaglest svn and linux users.

Main script performs ( among others ;] ) the function of updating, compiling and running the latest svn revision of the MegaGlest game.
Another scripts are designed for a newbies and/or a little more convenient users  to carry out the whole (a first) "installation process" on svn game.
The last script helps to download fast and fun all the official mods available in game mods' centre.

Everything is in one package and each user in it can find and get what he/she needs :).

I think it multiply the number of Megaglest betatesters ;)

When the script asks: Do you want to install or update some libraries?, you must agree on it.

since then everything should run unattended:

after an unattended "installation" is worth to review the log file, especially when compilation failed

run the script (location is specified in the summary of the installation)
